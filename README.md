## About me
  
I am [Amir Hallaji](https://amirhallaji.com).

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Shahid Beheshti University, where I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence. My studies focus on deep learning and natural language processing.

I work as a Backend Developer at Snapp, focusing on developing scalable software solutions. My role involves designing robust systems, optimizing code, and integrating APIs for improved functionality.

Outside of work, I love to work on open-source projects and continuously learning about new technologies to enhance my skills.
